You can clone the repository using either SSH or HTTPS, depending on your GitHub
connection setup. Use one of the following commands:

```bash
# Clone with SSH
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rustdelhi/rustdelhi.github.io.git

# Clone with HTTPS

```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

cd rustdelhi.github.io
```

### Start the Local Server

Now, you can use Zola to serve the website locally. Run the following command:
